These days, I’m thoroughly enjoying juggling work, studies, and playtime.

## 💼 Work & Projects
**Full-time role**: I’ve recently started working at SCB 10X as a Developer Relations Manager — or as I like to call it, LLM Evangelist. My mission? To cultivate a developer community around Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly our open-source model [Typhoon](https://opentyphoon.ai), developed by our team.

I see this as a pivotal initiative worth championing. It’s not just about tech — it’s a movement to empower Thai developers to go beyond being "users" and become active contributors, accelerating Thailand’s journey toward AI sovereignty.

**Consulting & Instruction**: Partnering with Make it Lab as a Behavioral Science consultant and instructor to explore how organizations can utilize the science of human behavior to better engage with their users and achieve their goals.

Previous freelance work: Before diving into this full-time role, I advised and taught courses for various organizations and universities, focusing on Inbound Marketing and Responsible AI.

## Health & Fitness
🏋🏻‍♀️ Still hitting CrossFit regularly! Recently competed in the CrossFit Open and determined to push my limits further this year. Too many goals to list here…

🎾 Taking tennis lessons (just hope to enjoy games with friends).

## 🧠 Learning
Work-related focus: Diving deep into LLM frameworks and developer tools (as you’d expect).

Non-work passions: Beyond tennis? Recently learned the basics of specialty coffee brewing (obsessed with drip coffee!). But let’s be real — I still buy way more than I make. 😅
