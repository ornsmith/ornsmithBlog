## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
Glad to see you're interested in hearing more about me! This page is kinda long as I've tried to reflect on who I am and who I want to be.

## Who am I?
When I write online, I go by the pen name Orn Smith.
I'm a writer, educator, and entrepreneur driven to make a positive impact. I've dedicated my career to empowering individuals and shaping industries.

## My Journey
At 23, I took a leap of faith and founded my own company. Since then, I've been on an incredible journey of personal and professional growth.

The media company I founded has reached and inspired over 7 million people, spreading knowledge and sparking change in the industry.

But I'm not one to rest on my laurels â€“ I'm always looking for the next challenge!

## Making Waves
I'm proud of the impact I've made in several areas:
- Advocating for Value-based Marketing: I'm on a mission to educate marketers about meaningful, long-term strategies that benefit both businesses and consumers.
- Empowering Content Writers: I've developed the nation's very first course in digital content writing in Thailand, creating job opportunities and raising the bar for quality content.
- Supporting the Startup Ecosystem: I've been a player in nurturing the startup community, including helping launch the largest tech conference in Southeast Asia and have been actively involved in various events that promote entrepreneurship.

## My Superpowers
- Bridge Builder: I'm well-rounded and love creating synergy across departments by bridging gaps between technical, creative, and business teams. My ability to speak multiple "languages" helps foster collaboration and innovation.
- Creator and Nurturer: With an entrepreneurial spirit, I excel at creating something from nothing and nurturing it to flourish. This makes me naturally drawn to both entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial roles where I can build and grow initiatives.
- Mindful Doer: I bring a unique blend of practicality and idealism to my work. As a practitioner with a vision, I'm able to execute tasks efficiently while keeping sight of larger goals and values.
- Adaptive Presenter: I have a knack for making things unique for specific group of audience. I enjoy the process of customizing and tailoring solutions, whether it's a project, a strategy, or a team approach, to ensure the best possible outcome.

## Beyond Work
I enjoy doing CrossFit, yoga and martial arts.
Fun facts:
- I ranked 29th among female CrossFitters in Thailand during the 2022 CrossFit Open! That was a good old day! I may not be as competitive as I was then nowadays but exercise is still a big part of my routine.
- Before that, I used to be training Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

Fitness is my way of staying grounded, both mentally and physically.

## What Drives Me
I believe in the power of human development â€”whether itâ€™s individual or a larger group of community. From a shy, self-doubting individual, Iâ€™ve transformed into someone who thrives on solving complex problems. Along the way, Iâ€™ve learned to build both mental and physical strength. I attribute much of this growth to the supportive communities Iâ€™ve been part of, from my tech startup network to my fitness community. Iâ€™m always learning and sharing my knowledge, constantly striving for balance between productivity and clarity.
