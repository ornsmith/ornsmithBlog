As a seasoned entrepreneur, I've played a pivotal role in the founding and growth of several successful ventures across diverse industries. My portfolio includes experiences in media & publication, education, digital marketing services, and e-commerce products.

One of my most notable accomplishments is the development of "Content Shifu," a leading digital marketing media, education, and ecosystem builder. From its inception, I spearheaded its growth into a thriving company that has established a strong presence in the market.
