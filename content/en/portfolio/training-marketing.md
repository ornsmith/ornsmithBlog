I'm passionate in educational design, capacity building and helping individuals and organizations grow. My specialization is in Inbound Marketing and related fields.

Inbound Marketing (Digital Marketing Strategy)

Inbound Marketing is a set of proven marketing strategies that brings together branding, content marketing, first-party data collection, and marketing technology. It’s been a secret sauce of how I acquired and retain customers of my businesses, as well as providing the service to my clients. I’ve been one of the key leader and evangelist of this strategy in Thailand (as displayed in my teaching and publications).

Authority Building & 


Public Relations & Influencer Marketing (Local & International)

As a journalist myself, I’ve been working with several media and PR agencies and was a key leader in my former companies who developed relationship with media and PR companies. Apart from that, I have experience being a international influencer outreach team leader. I outreached around 1,000 social media influencers across many regions of the world to promote the e-commerce product of the company.

Educational Design

Apart from being an instructor myself, my role was to serve my company as a director of academy. I co-designed courses and their curriculums with other instructors. More importantly, I researched and worked with my clients and my students to deliver effective learning outcomes that serve their goals.

Event Organization & Content Curation

I’ve organized both in-person and online events. I understand and am able to lead every area in training and small-to-medium events. For a large conference event (500+ attendees), I usually serve as a curator who co-designs the theme and the topics in the event that are both valuable and marketable.
