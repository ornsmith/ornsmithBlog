Iâ€™m a writer, educator, and entrepreneur driven to make a positive impact. Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to empowering individuals and shaping industries.\nMy Journey At 23, I took a leap of faith and founded my own company. Since then, Iâ€™ve been on an incredible journey of personal and professional growth.\nThe media company I founded has reached and inspired over 7 million people, spreading knowledge and sparking change in the industry.\nBut Iâ€™m not one to rest on my laurels â€“ Iâ€™m always looking for the next challenge!\nMaking Waves Iâ€™m proud of the impact Iâ€™ve made in several areas:\nAdvocating for Value-based Marketing: Iâ€™m on a mission to educate marketers about meaningful, long-term strategies that benefit both businesses and consumers. Empowering Content Writers: Iâ€™ve developed the nationâ€™s very first course in digital content writing in Thailand, creating job opportunities and raising the bar for quality content. Supporting the Startup Ecosystem: Iâ€™ve been a player in nurturing the startup community, including helping launch the largest tech conference in Southeast Asia and have been actively involved in various events that promote entrepreneurship. My Superpowers Bridge Builder: Iâ€™m well-rounded and love creating synergy across departments by bridging gaps between technical, creative, and business teams. My background wearing multiple hats helps foster collaboration and innovation. Creator and Nurturer: With an entrepreneurial spirit, I excel at creating something from nothing and nurturing it to flourish. This makes me naturally drawn to both entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial roles where I can build and grow initiatives. Mindful Doer: I bring a unique blend of practicality and idealism to my work. As a practitioner with a vision, Iâ€™m able to execute tasks efficiently while keeping sight of larger goals and values. Adaptive Presenter: I have a knack for making things unique for specific group of audience. I enjoy the process of customizing and tailoring solutions, whether itâ€™s a project, a strategy, or a team approach, to ensure the best possible outcome. Beyond Work I enjoy doing CrossFit, yoga and martial arts. Fun facts:\nI ranked 29th among female CrossFitters in Thailand during the 2022 CrossFit Open! That was a good old day! I may not be as competitive as I was then nowadays but exercise is still a big part of my routine. Before that, I used to be training Taekwondo, Judo, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Fitness is my way of staying grounded, both mentally and physically.\nWhat Drives Me I believe in the power of human development â€”whether itâ€™s individual or a larger group of community. From a shy, self-doubting individual, Iâ€™ve transformed into someone who thrives on solving complex problems. Along the way, Iâ€™ve learned to build both mental and physical strength. I attribute much of this growth to the supportive communities Iâ€™ve been part of, from my tech startup network to my fitness community. Iâ€™m always learning and sharing my knowledge, constantly striving for balance between productivity and clarity.\nRecognitions Fellow, James R.
